This repo will have a github action that runs on a schedule to listen for any releases to HDZ Goggle Firmware.

It'll then output a json file to this repo - containing information about the releases.

TODO:
Configure the github action to commit a random change to this repo - this is to keep the github action from becoming stale and stopping execution.
